// Element Vs Node

//Every element is node but every node is not a element

//Element show in html collection and node show in NodeList

// when we write anything in our html without in element it will become node element also a node
// Ex-comment, text without any tag,attribute etc.
// there are many types of node=> comment,text,element,attribute etc
// every node has their number called nodeValue like 1,3 etc

// Access nodes in body => document.body.childNodes
// or click on anything and go property tab and search node then you will gat that value etc

// Ex=> (change comment value which is written in body)
// document.body.childNodes[3].nodeValue='jai'
